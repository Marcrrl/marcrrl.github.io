## Getting Started

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.2.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development server

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Build

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
